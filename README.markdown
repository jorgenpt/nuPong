Setup
=====

This project uses cocoapods to pull in dependencies. To get started, you
only need to run the following from the command line:

    pod install


And then open `nuPong.xcworkspace`.

To learn more about cocoapods, [read their
website](http://cocoapods.org/).


The code is intended to be cross-platform, and uses only C++11, libc,
OpenGL, and cross-platform third party libraries -- all of which should
be portable. To run it on other platforms, all you need should be a set
of build scripts.
